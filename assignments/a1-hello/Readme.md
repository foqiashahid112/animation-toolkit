# Many Particles!
*Question 3*

Create 100+ particles, randomly distributed across the screen

Particles should all move in the same direction, but at different speeds

Particles should wrap when they move off the screen. For example, if a particleâ€™s X position is greater than the window width, it should be reset to 0.

Particle colors should also be randomized
